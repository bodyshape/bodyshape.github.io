		<h3>Food</h3>
		Do you need to lose weight? This tool will definitely assist you in achieving your goal!
	</div>

	<div class="description">
		Every food has a point value. These points are based on the amount of calories, fat, fiber and carbohydrates (carbs).
		Every day, a maximum number of points are allowed based on your weight. These points are defined as follows:
		<ul>
			<li class="list">less than 130 = 18</li>
			<li class="list">131-140 = 20</li>
			<li class="list">141-155 = 21</li>
			<li class="list">156-175 = 22</li>
			<li class="list">175-200 = 23</li>
			<li class="list">201-250 = 24</li>
			<li class="list">251+ = 25</li>
		</ul>

		Here's a quick example:
		<table> <tr> <th>&nbsp;</th> <th> <a href="http://www.nutritiondata.com/facts/foods-from-burger-king/6748/2" target="_blank">Original Double Whopper&reg; With Cheese Sandwich</a> </th> <th> <a href="http://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/asian_turkey_burgers.html" target="_blank">Asian turkey burger</a> </th> </tr> <tr> <td>Calories:</td> <td>1070</td> <td>207</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Fat (g):</td> <td>70</td> <td>3</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Fibers (g):</td> <td>4</td> <td>4</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Carbs (g):</td> <td>53</td> <td>20</td> </tr> <tr> <th>EBS Points:</th> <th>27.6</th> <th>4.0</th> </tr> </table>
		<br/>
		Here are some very simple changes that you can start today that will improve your chances of weight loss:
		<ul>
			<li class="list">Eat frequent but small meals</li>
			<li class="list">Drink 8 to 10 glasses of distilled water a day</li>
			<li class="list">Eat lots of raw fruits and vegetables</li>
			<li class="list">Avoid drinking calories; coffee, alcohol, soda pop, etc...</li>

			<li class="list">Avoid red meat and animal fats</li>
			<li class="list">Build your meals around fish, tofu or poultry</li>
			<li class="list">Cut out fried foods</li>
			<li class="list">Start with a soup or a salad</li>

	<h3>Exercise</h3>
	You need to lose weight? This tool will definitely guide you to achieve your goal.
	</div>
	<div class="description">
		Changing your eating habits is the first step of losing weight. The second one, is exercising. 
		Losing weight can not be done overnight. Like the food tool, the exercise tool can help you lose weight using our points system.
		For example, a 180 pound man can eat 23 points a day. He exercised for 30 minutes at a moderate level. 
		Therefore, the number of total points is 3. 
		These points are not added to the number of points you can eat but subtracted from the total amount allowed.
		In other words, although he ate 23 points that day it would only count as if he ate 20 points that day.
		<p>** As a reminder, aim to lose 1-2lbs per week as this is the safest amount to lose per week.</p>

		<h3>Body Mass Index</h3>
		Are you underweight, overweight or within a healthy weight range?
	</div>
	<div class="description">
		Body Mass Index or BMI is a measure utilized determine weight status. 
		In other words, this tool tells you if you are underweight, overweight or within a healthy weight range.
		Body Mass Index is a measurement of body fat based on height and weight for both men and women.
		Look at this chart to find out your status:

		<table class="left"> <tr> <th>&nbsp;</th> <th> BMI </th> </tr> <tr> <td>Underweight:</td> <td>Less than 18.5</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Ideal Weight:</td> <td>Between 18.5 and 24.9</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Overweight:</td> <td>Between 25 and 29.9</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Obesity:</td> <td>Between 30 and 39.9</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Morbid Obesity:</td> <td>40+</td> </tr> </table>

		<p>** Note: Being overweight increases the chances of serious health risks like heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure.</p>
		<p>** Note: Body Mass Index is not a foolproof measurement. Though muscle tissue weighs more than fat tissue, BMI calculation doesn't recognize the difference between muscle and fat. This tool leads for those who are more sedentary.</p>
